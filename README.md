## Summary
When I was a college student, I did a two-year internship at a startup company, and developed in-house products. After that, I joined a major Software company and had been engaged in web application development and cloud planning and construction. Less than a year and a half after joining the company, I was selected as the leader of a project worth approximately 0.9 million dollars, and completed the project as planned by coordinating with various departments and handling issues.

I am currently working as a freelance web engineer, doing both front-end and back-end development and management. I sometimes join new development projects and am involved in the selection of technologies such as languages and architectures, as well as the consideration of PJ management policies. In addition, I may be entrusted with coordinating with other departments.

I can handle a variety of tasks beyond development, such as optimization for smooth team development.

In addition, I am also involved in the following non-work related activities.

- Developing a restaurant search LINEBOT (over 300 registered friends)
- Speaking at events (in front of about 120 people)
- Regularly posting on Qiita/Zenn (trending multiple times, highest daily ranking: #1)
  - Qiita/Zenn is like Japanese DEV Community

Recently, I'm really into web3. I have been working on developing dApps ([Heart Rate Art](https://yagi-eng.gitbook.io/resume/portfolio#heart-rate-art)) in my free time.
