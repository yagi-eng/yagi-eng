## Management
- As a project manager and project leader, managed a team of 6 people
- As a scrum master, introduced Scrum to a team of 8 people
- Experience of cost planning, purchasing, progress management, task management, risk management, issue handling, coordination with other departments, etc...

## Time as new recruit
As a leader of new service development, I stood between each department and completed it. (Related departments; Planning, Construction, Sales, Maintenance, and Project Support)
In addition, I actively engaged in tasks that I had never experienced before, such as mentoring French internship student and serving as an instructor for in-house training about virtualization technology.
I was able to receive the best evaluation for the above achievements and attitude.

## Present
I joined an engineering team that was not functioning as a team, and created a situation where we could function as a team and improve productivity. Specifically, I made rules for team management, organized the backlog, and clarified how to interact with stakeholders.
