## Management
Experience in managing a team of 6 people as a project manager and project leader

(Cost planning, purchasing, progress management, task management, risk management, issue handling, coordination with other departments)

## Time as a company employee
As a leader of new service construction, I stood between each department and completed the construction of the service. (Related departments: Planning, Construction, Sales, Maintenance, and Project Support)
In addition, I actively engaged in tasks that I had never experienced before, such as mentoring French internship students and serving as an instructor for in-house training about virtualization technology.
I was able to receive the best evaluation for the above achievements and attitude.

## Present (freelance)
I joined an engineering team that was not functioning as a team, and created a situation where we could function as a team and improve productivity. Specifically, I made rules for team management, organized the backlog, and clarified how to interact with stakeholders.
