# Profile
When I was a 3rd and 4th year student at university, I did an internship at a venture company and experienced developing in-house tools. After that, I joined a major IT company and ha been engaged in web application development and private cloud planning and construction. Less than a year and a half after joining the company, I was selected as the leader of a PJ which budget is approximately 0.9 million dollars, and completed the PJ as planned by negotiating with various departments and dealing with issues.

Currently, I am working as a freelance web engineer, doing both front-end and back-end development. I sometimes join new development projects and get involved in selecting technologies such as languages and architectures, as well as reviewing PJ management policies. I may also be entrusted to coordinate with other departments.

Using the wide range of experience I gained as a company employee and my professional experience as a freelancer, I can handle a variety of tasks beyond development, such as optimizing a team for smooth development.

In addition, I am also involved in the following non-work related activities.

- Speaking at events (in front of about 120 people)
- Developing a restaurant search LINEBOT (over 300 registered friends)
- Regularly posting on Qiita (trending multiple times, highest daily ranking: #1)
  - Qiita is like Japanese DEV Community

## Management
Experience in managing a team of 6 people as a project manager and project leader

(Cost planning, purchasing, progress management, task management, risk management, issue handling, coordination with other departments)


## Time as a company employee
As a leader of new service construction, I stood between each department and completed the construction of the service. (Related departments: Planning, Construction, Sales, Maintenance, and Project Support)
In addition, I actively engaged in tasks that I had never experienced before, such as mentoring French internship students and serving as an instructor for in-house training about virtualization technology.
I was able to receive the best evaluation for the above achievements and attitude.

## Present (freelance)
I joined an engineering team that was not functioning as a team, and created a situation where we could function as a team and improve productivity. Specifically, I made rules for team management, organized the backlog, and clarified how to interact with stakeholders.
