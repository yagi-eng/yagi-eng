## Highlights
I often have the opportunity to participate in the launch of new products and the early phases of development, with a strong focus on technology selection, team building, and establishing development structures.

As a CTO and Tech Lead in a startup, I have experience building a development organization from scratch and have contributed to improving team productivity through the introduction of Scrum and the establishment of development processes. I frequently receive feedback such as, "We can now visualize the development process," "We can now prioritize and develop the most important features," and "The development flow has been established, allowing for highly productive development."

Additionally, I am capable of handling all aspects of development, from requirements definition to design, implementation, and operation. I especially focus on designing systems with long-term maintainability in mind, putting emphasis on creating architectures that are easy to maintain. This has contributed to both system scalability and reducing operational costs.

I strive to provide value across product, team, and technology aspects, always aiming to deliver impact in these areas.
